This is a list of the books in my personal library.

I haven't read every book here, nor do I own all the books I've read
or like. I also don't necessarily like all the books I own.

Uses the [Library of Congress Classification](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Classification#Classification) (LCC) system. The LCC class and sub-class for each book was found using [worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/) and [classify](http://classify.oclc.org/classify2/). Class and sub-class groupings are based on [lukesmith.xyz/library](https://lukesmith.xyz/library/).
